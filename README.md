# Machine Learning 4 Construction
In this project we build classifier for [Iris Plants dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#iris-dataset)
#### Next steps have been done:
1. Data exploration
2. Training several models and choise the best one
3. Development of API for new eaxmples classification which uses trained model fom Step 2
4.
